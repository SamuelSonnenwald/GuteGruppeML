## Our Business Case
The present program code reflects our self-chosen scenario, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of marketing for a luxury real estate firm. We deliberately chose this scenario to illustrate all aspects, from selecting metrics to making decisions during the modeling process. The focus is on targeting customers with an income above $50,000.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this Jupyter Notebook, make sure to install the required Python packages. You can do this by executing the following commands in your Jupyter Notebook environment or your terminal.

## Installation Steps:

1. **Python Version:**
   - Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Package Installation:**
   - Open your terminal or Jupyter Notebook cell.
   - Copy and paste the following commands:

     ```bash
        pip install pandas
        pip install numpy
        pip install seaborn
        pip install matplotlib
        pip install scikit-learn
        pip install imbalanced-learn
        pip install plotly
     ```

     The above commands will install the necessary packages for running the code in this notebook.

3. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using:

     ```python
     pip install jupyter
     ```

4. **Additional Notes:**
   - Make sure to run the commands with the appropriate permissions, especially if you encounter any issues.

## Verification:

After completing the installation steps, restart the Jupyter Notebook kernel and run the code cells. If there are no error messages, you have successfully installed the required packages.
